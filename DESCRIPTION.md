# hello-world
A repository of my project to KPIT CoE "Student Attendance System".

ABSTRACT:
I'm using the code in the file : 
1.To get Student details as input ,
2.To get the input of attendance multiple times ,
3.To view the Absentees and their details ,
4.To view number of days present , total number of working days and attendance percentage .

APPLICATION:
-->Can be used as an ATTENDANCE System in :
   1.Schools
   2.Colleges
   3.Banks
   4.and Other instituitions
 This is achieved Through Face_Recognition Camera which recognises the faces of the students , staffs , employees ,etc.,
 of the instituition and gives input as '1' if the face is recognized . Or else the input to the program will be '0'.
 thus the attendance for a particular number of days can be recorded by embedded systems and the faculties or incharge's may
 get to know about the absentees. Thus it provides us with an oppurtunity of avoiding Human Errors and mainting records for 
 a long period in terms of smaller storages without wastimg papers or ink. 

-->We can also achieve this using RF tag sensors or finger print sensors or QR code sensors ,etc.

-->Thus the work of attendance and maintaining records becomes even more EASIER and RELIABLE.

-->If any faults with sensors , Human may also upload it to the program during runtime(as in this program)

LOGICS:
-->using structure to contain student details and records.

-->using Switch statement for giving multiple choices as output for user

-->using goto statement for repetition of codes , giving multiple choices to user , for input of attendance for each day.

COMPLICATIONS or LIMITATIONS:
-->Its scope is limited by the user definition and the limitations of the sensors.

THANK YOU.
